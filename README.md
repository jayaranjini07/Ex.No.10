## Date: 22-10-2025
## Reg. No. 212223060101

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## 1.Decision making prompt 
## Prompt:
Act as a business consultant. Based on current market trends, should a startup invest in electric scooter rentals in Tier-2 Indian cities? Provide a short feasibility report with key pros, cons, and a final recommendation.
## Output:
# Feasibility Report — Electric Scooter Rentals in Tier-2 Indian Cities
## Executive Summary  
Electric two-wheelers are the fastest-growing EV segment in India and rental/micromobility is an expanding sub-market. Policy support and charging infrastructure are improving coverage, but adoption and economics vary by state and city. A targeted, asset-light pilot focused on high-use micro-markets (college districts, market areas, tourist hubs, delivery partnerships) is recommended rather than an immediate large fleet roll-out.

---

## Key Market Signals (Evidence)  
- Electric 2-wheeler sales are large and growing. EV two- and three-wheelers dominate India’s EV sales mix; total EV sales exceeded ~2 million units in FY24–25 with two-wheelers a major share.  
- Rental/micromobility market is forecast to grow sharply. Industry reports project strong CAGR for bike/scooter rental markets in India (double-digit growth to 2030), with electric propulsion being the fastest segment.  
- Charging & incentive programs are expanding, but uneven. Central/state schemes for EV incentives and charging infrastructure are accelerating, though distribution favors some states and urban corridors more than others.  
- Policy & price volatility matters. Subsidy changes, local policy shifts, and OEM pricing moves materially affect retail EV uptake and secondary markets — this affects fleet CAPEX and residual values.

---

## Pros (Why Tier-2 is Attractive)  
- Lower competition & lower unit economics for location versus saturated metros — easier regulatory engagement and partner negotiations with local governments.  
- Strong local use-cases: short intra-city trips (markets, colleges, transit last-mile), tourism routes, and gig/delivery use where two-wheelers are preferred.  
- Growing EV awareness & policy tailwinds — central/state funding for charging reduces one barrier over the medium term.  
- Opportunity for differentiated models: subscriptions, B2B delivery partnerships, battery-swap or depot-charging, campus/tourist packages.

---

## Cons / Risks (What Can Kill Unit Economics)  
- Charging & operations overheads: depot/charging costs, need for battery management or swap logistics if no convenient home charging exists.  
- Demand sensitivity to price & weather: Tier-2 customers have lower disposable incomes — rentals must be very affordable or value-added.  
- Asset risk: theft, vandalism, and maintenance can be costlier per unit in dispersed geographies.  
- Policy & subsidy uncertainty: sudden subsidy reduction or local regulatory limits can change margins or the total addressable market quickly.

---

## Unit-Economics & Go-to-Market Notes (High Level)  
- Two validated levers: utilization (rides per scooter per day) and average revenue per ride (incl. subscriptions). Focus on maximizing utilization through concentrated parking/geo-fencing and B2B contracts (last-mile/delivery).  
- CAPEX mitigation: prefer asset-light (revenue-share with OEMs/owners) or staged CAPEX (pilot 50–150 scooters) to prove demand before scaling.  
- Service model: hybrid — docked depots for overnight charging + swap/field teams for rebalancing. Partner with local charging providers or use swappable batteries where available.

---

## Practical Recommendation (Final)  
Recommendation: Proceed with a focused pilot  
- Start small; avoid a large upfront fleet purchase.  
- Run a 6–12 month pilot in 1–2 Tier-2 cities selected on objective criteria (college density, tourist footfall, delivery demand, municipal openness). Start with 50–150 scooters.  
- Use an asset-light mix (leased or revenue-share) and target two revenue streams: consumer short-trips + B2B last-mile/subscription deals.  
- Prioritize cities where charging infrastructure rollout or state incentives are active, and where partner OEMs or local fleet management vendors exist.  
- Monitor state policy and residual-value trends monthly.

---

## Quick Action Plan (First 90 Days)  
1. City selection: Shortlist 3 Tier-2 cities using metrics: population density, tourist arrivals, student population, delivery volumes, charging points per 10k population.  
2. Pilot model: 50–150 scooters; asset-light leases or partnership with local dealer; depot charging + battery swap options.  
3. Partnerships: OEMs or local 2W dealers, charging network providers, local delivery platforms.  
4. KPIs to track: Daily utilization, ARPU per scooter, maintenance cost per km, theft/insurance losses, customer NPS.  
5. Decision gate at 6 months: Scale if utilization and unit economics meet targets; otherwise pivot to B2B (delivery/subscription) or exit.

## 2.Comparative prompt:
## Prompt
Compare two business models — subscription-based streaming vs ad-supported streaming — in terms of revenue stability, scalability, and customer retention.
## Output
# Comparative Analysis: Subscription-Based vs Ad-Supported Streaming Models

## 1. Revenue Stability  
- Subscription-Based Model:  
  - Generates predictable and recurring revenue through monthly or annual fees.  
  - Less affected by fluctuations in advertiser demand or economic downturns.  
  - However, churn (user cancellations) can cause sudden revenue drops if content value declines.  

- Ad-Supported Model:  
  - Revenue depends on advertising spend and viewer engagement, making it volatile and cyclical.  
  - Stronger performance during economic growth or when ad budgets are high.  
  - Requires large user volumes to offset low per-user revenue.  

**Verdict:** Subscription models offer higher revenue stability, while ad-supported models are more market-sensitive.

---

## 2. Scalability  
- Subscription-Based Model:  
  - Growth is limited by consumers’ willingness to pay and content differentiation.  
  - Scaling requires high-quality, exclusive content or partnerships to justify recurring fees.  
  - Payment gateway and regional pricing challenges can restrict global expansion.  

- Ad-Supported Model:  
  - Highly scalable — can attract mass audiences with free access.  
  - Easier to enter price-sensitive markets and leverage data-driven ad personalization.  
  - However, infrastructure and data management costs rise with user growth.  

**Verdict:** Ad-supported streaming is more scalable due to lower user acquisition friction.

---

## 3. Customer Retention  
- Subscription-Based Model:  
  - Encourages stronger user loyalty through personalized recommendations, premium experience, and ad-free viewing.  
  - Retention relies on consistent content refresh and perceived value for price.  
  - Discounts or bundles (e.g., family plans, telecom tie-ups) can reduce churn.  

- Ad-Supported Model:  
  - Retention is generally lower, as users face ads and often switch to competing free platforms.  
  - Engagement depends on ad relevance and user experience quality (too many ads can drive attrition).  
  - Hybrid “freemium” tiers can help transition loyal users to paid plans.  

**Verdict:** Subscription models achieve higher retention through better user experience and brand stickiness.

---

## Summary Table  

| Factor | Subscription-Based Model | Ad-Supported Model |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Revenue Stability | High – predictable recurring income | Moderate – depends on ad market cycles |
| Scalability | Moderate – limited by paying users | High – accessible to large audiences |
| Customer Retention | Strong – driven by content loyalty | Weak to Moderate – ad fatigue possible |
| Monetization Per User | High | Low to Medium |
| Entry Barrier for Users | High (requires payment) | Low (free access) |

---

## Final Recommendation  
- For premium or niche content (e.g., Netflix, Spotify Premium), the subscription model ensures predictable revenue and loyal customers.  
- For mass-market or emerging markets (e.g., YouTube, MX Player), the ad-supported model scales faster and attracts wide audiences.  
- Hybrid (freemium) models — offering free ad-supported tiers with optional paid upgrades — are now the most balanced and sustainable approach for long-term growth.
